# Delivery time

Keep in mind that this is an on-going project...

The main idea is to create a highly customizable web that offers an alternative to PedidosYa or Rappi for
local restaurants.
In the final product you will be able to add items to a cart and then through the API of WhatsApp send a message to the restaurant with the information and the address of the person through a WhatsApp generated text.
The idea is to sell it to many restaurants, so I will be able to easily change the assets, or for a price add another
functionality, and through modifying JSON files I can update the menu in any time.

In order to finish it I think I need to use Redux, so I'm learning it...
